# Disabled Parking Visual Traking System (DPVTS)

This is the source code of the DPVTS project. It is a thesis project for electronics engineering bachelor degree at Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Malaysia. 

## Developed by: Munaib Al-Helali
## Supervised by: Cheong Soon Nyean
## Year: 2019

## The project consists of three parts: 
- Base station: is a Raspberry Pi3 based station to detect and track cars in the parking area and update the parking lots status accordingly. 
- Dashboard: is a web dashboard to visualize and track the parking trends in the parking area over time.
- Barricade: is a device based on arduino. It is installed at the center of earch parking lot and can be controled through a dedicated android application or through the base station. It communicate with the base station through LoRa module over long distance.

## Programming languages used:
- Python: base station
- C++: barricade
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: web dashboard

## Other technologies or libraries:
- OpenCV
- Numpy 
- Firebase database
- LoRA
- Raspbarry Pi3
- Arduino
